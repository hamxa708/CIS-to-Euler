This repository contains a code project that provides a utility for converting imaginary numbers to Euler form and includes a plotting feature. The code is written in <programming language> and offers a convenient way to perform the conversion and visualize the results.

Features
Converts imaginary numbers to Euler form: The code implements a function that takes an imaginary number as input and accurately converts it to Euler form. It handles both real and complex numbers, calculating the magnitude and phase components.

Includes plotting functionality: The repository includes a plotting module that utilizes a popular plotting library. Once the imaginary number is converted to Euler form, the code generates a graph that visualizes the magnitude and phase of the converted number. The plot is customizable, allowing users to adjust various parameters, such as labels, axes, and styling.
  I created this code on Jupytar notebook. The libraries which need to be imported are already in the code.
